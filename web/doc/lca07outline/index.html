<h2>Abstract</h2>

The techniques presented in this paper came about from a project
where it was known in advance that at least two tools needed to be
based on the same grammar.  The requirement was to translate an
application-specific language into C, and also produce a pretty-printer.
This is often done with two separate grammar files which differ not in
syntax but in the semantic code added to each grammar production.  Is
it possible to have a single grammar file and use it in two different
tools?
<p>
A technique is presented which separates the grammar from the semantic
processing, using simple C++ polymorphism, allowing two or more tools
to share the same grammar code.  The use of factory methods makes this
possible.  The implementation of a grammar using these factories is
described, as well as some unexpected benefits and simplifications.

<h3>Assumed Knowledge</h3>

The reader is expected to be aware of Yacc grammars and
understand basic OO concepts as implemented in C++.

<h3>Open Source Projects</h3>

There are two open source (GPL) projects which are using
the techniques in this paper:
<ul><li>
The <a
.nf
href="http://ucsd-psystem-xc.sourceforge.net/"
.fi
> UCSD p-System
Cross Compiler</a> project provides a Pascal cross compiler for
producing UCSD p-System code files on Posix hosts, such as Linux.  This
started as a nostalgic trip down memory lane, and turned into a serious
piece of retro-computing.
<li>
The <a
.nf
href="http://tickle.sourceforge.net/"
.fi
> Tickle</a> project is
an open-source implementation of a compiler for the domain-specific
language called Transaction Control Language (TCL).
</ul>

<h2>Biographical Details</h2>

Peter Miller have been a code cutter since he was 14, and built his
first computer with a soldering iron, it was a kit from Dick Smith.
Since then he has been coding for a little over 30 years, and have (so
far) avoided the management trap and still codes professionally.  He
have been giving away code since before there was a GPL, and once he
came across it he has used the GPL for all of his "non commercial"
output ever since.  He has 25 years experience with C and 15 years
experience with C++.


<h2>Previous Speaking Experience</h2>

Peter Miller has presented papers at AUUG conferences and chapter
meetings.  He has given talks at SLUG meetings.  He has organised a few
CodeCon weekends for "camping and coding".

    A grammar is built up from many productions which describe the
    structure if the language.  Parsing is the process of grouping
    tokens to match the specified productions of the grammar.  These
    productions are usually similar to &ldquo;BNF&rdquo; notation.  In
    <i>yacc</i> you can attach <tt>{ C code in braces }</tt> to be
    executed when a production matches.

    It is possible for a parser to build a series of dynamically
    allocated linked data structures which represent the input which
    has been parsed.  Where these data structures correspond closely to
    the grammar, they are called <i>abstract syntax trees</i>.

<h2> Open Source Projects </h2>

There are two open source (GPL) projects which are using
the techniques in this talk:
<ul><li>
The <a
.nf
href="http://ucsd-psystem-xc.sourceforge.net/"
.fi
>UCSD p-System
Cross Compiler</a> project provides a Pascal cross compiler for
producing UCSD p-System code files on Posix hosts, such as Linux.  This
started as a nostalgic trip down memory lane, and turned into a serious
piece of retro-computing.
<br>
<tt>ucsd-psystem-xc.sourceforge.net</tt>
<p>
<li>
The <a href="http://tickle.sourceforge.net/"> Tickle</a> project is
an open-source implementation of a compiler for the domain-specific
language called Transaction Control Language (TCL).
<br>
<tt>tickle.sourceforge.net</tt>
</ul>

The target for this release was to be able to compile the UCSD native
Pascal compiler from source.  This has been achieved.  It has yet to be
determined if the compiler thus created actually functions.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
For differences between this cross compiler and the UCSD native
compiler, see the \f[I]ucsdpsys_compile\fP(1) man page.  The most
notable difference is that SIZEOF is a keyword, requiring the UCSD
native compiler's PROCEDURE SIZEOF to be renamed.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 65, 75, 77, 97, 210, 217
Numerous bugs have been fixed, usually in unexplored corner cases.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 43, 45, 48, 55, 89, 111, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 130
.\" Change 134, 136, 137, 139, 144, 145, 148, 149, 150, 151, 153, 154
.\" Change 157, 165, 184, 191, 192, 193, 194, 197
The compiler now understands the ABS, BLOCKREAD, BLOCKWRITE, CLOSE,
CONCAT, EXIT, HALT, IDSEARCH, IORESULT, KEYBOARD, LENGTH, MARK, MOD,
MOVELEFT, MOVERIGHT, OPENNEW, OPENOLD, PWROFTEN, READ, READLN, RELEASE,
RESET, REWRITE, ROUND, SCAN, TREESEARCH, TRUNC, UNITREAD, UNITWRITE and
WRITELN built\[hy]in symbols.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 95
The STRING type has been turned into a built\[hy]in named type.  This permits
the unwise user to redefine STRING to be a variable or a procedure or
a function, or (for maximum confusion) a different type.  This is
what shadow warnings are for.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 14, 20, 22, 23, 79, 81, 94
The compiler now understands the CASE, FOR, REPEAT UNTIL and WITH
statements.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88
The compiler now understands comparisons of CHAR values.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 80
The compiler now accepts pointers as parameters to the ORD function.
This seems oddly inconsistent, in a language as intent as Pascal is,
with the protection of the programmer from his own folly.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73
The compiler now understands set arithmetic and set comparisons.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 61, 62, 63
It is now possible, using the \f[I]ucsdpsys_compile \-\-listing\fP option,
to obtain a compiler listing.
The listing contains the source code interleaved with the disassembled
p\[hy]code.
The \f[CW](*$L)\fP control comment is ignored.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 31, 32
The compiler now understands = and <> comparisons of multi\[hy]word values
(arrays and records).
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 42
The compiler can now be configured to have longer identifier
(name) lengths.  It defaults to 8 for compatibility, and it
still drops underscores.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30
The compiler now understands comparisons of packed arrays of char.

When creating test cases, it is normal to compile the code with the
Apple Pascal compiler, and then disassemble it.  This forms the expected
output.

1. prepare your source file

   vi example.text

2. you need a system to work in

   cp /home/vault/ucsd-p-system/p-interp-0.5/apple_pascal_0.dsk work.dsk

3. insert ("put") your source code into the disk image

   ucsdpsys_disk -f work.dsk -p example.text

4. run the vm using the disk image as 0:

   ucsdpsys_vm -w work.dsk

5. from within the system, compile your code

   C(ompile
   Compile what text? example^M
   To what codefile? example^M

6. from within the system, halt

   H(alt

7. extract the code file from the disk image

   ucsdpsys_disk -f work.dsk -g example.code

8. disassemble the code

   linux-x86_64/bin/ucsdpsys_disassemble -a example.code -o test.ok

9. OR, just use the shell script:

   sh bl/etc/example.sh

# vim: set ts=8 sw=4 et :

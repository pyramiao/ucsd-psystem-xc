The following built\[hy]in functions are understood:
CHR,
MEMAVAIL,
ODD,
ORD,
PRED,
SIZEOF,
SQR,
SUCC,
TIME.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
All of the usual Pascal expresion operators are understood,
although not always across the full range of parameter types.
.TP 2n

The cross compiler can produce both little\[hy]endian codefiles and
big\[hy]endian codefiles.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
A number of features from modern Pascal implementations are avilable:
hex constants, binary constants, short\[hy]circuit boolean evaluation,
the address\[hy]of (@) operator,
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Most of the Pascal statement types are available, including:
BEGIN END,
CASE (and OTHERWISE),
FOR,
GOTO (local),
IF THEN (ELSE),
NEW (including variant types),
REPEAT UNTIL,
WHILE,
WITH,
WRITE,
WRITELN.
It is not yet possble to use non\[hy]local GOTO.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Segment procedures can be created, and UNIT interfaces can be accessed
from library codefiles.  It is not yet possible to compile UNITs.
While FORWARD procedures and functions are understood,
EXTERNAL procedures and functions are not yet supported.

All of the UCSD Pascal data types are supported:
ARRAY (including PACKED ARRAY),
BOOLEAN,
CHAR,
enumerated,
FILE,
INTEGER
INTERACTIVE,
pointers,
REAL,
RECORD (including PACKED RECORD),
SET,
STRING (including STRING[n]),
subrange,
TEXT.
The long integer types are not yet supported.

The cross compiler understands
many of the UCSD Pascal constants, including:
FALSE,
MAXINT,
NIL,
TRUE,
.TP 2n

The cross compiler is able to optimize most statements and expressions
better than the Apple Pascal native compiler.
Constant expressions are folded at compile time.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a \f[I]ucsdpsys_depends\fP(1) command, that can be used by your
build system to scan for \f[CW](*$I filename*)\fP include directives.

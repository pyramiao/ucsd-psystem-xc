The compiler now understands EXTERNAL function and procedure
declarations, and produces corresponding linker records.

The compiler now understands the built\[hy]in STR function.

.\" Change 59
It is now possible to write long integer constants in the source
code.  They take the same forms as other integer constants, except
they are suffixed with the letter L.  This is an idea
transplanted from C, the UCSD native compiler does not recognise
such constants.  It makes testing and debugging the long integer constant
folding much easier.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Changes 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 28
The compiler now understands \f[CW]unit\fP definitions, using II.1
syntax and semantics.  If II.0 \f[CW]separate unit\fP definitions are
seen, they result in a warning, and the \f[CW]separate\fP keyword is
otherwise ignored.
.TP 2n
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 55
The compiler now understands a C\[hy]style ternary operator expression
\f[CW](e1 ? e2 : e3)\fP.  The UCSD native compiler doesn't have this.
